# MORPH
Morph - customizable syntax meta programming language. Have you ever wished you could change some aspects of the syntax pf your favourite programming language? Remove semicolons from C? Make erlang prettier? Make Java less verbose? Well now you can!

Using morph you can define custom syntax for your programming language, write code in your custom syntax and then have morph compile it for you in the compiler accepted version. You can also compile one language into the other using Morph, or even create new languages, or add syntax features into existing ones.

# Todo:
* Morph needs to be able to translate standard code to custom syntax
* Morph needs ability to add flexible and programmable rules
